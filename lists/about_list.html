title: Some Things About Me
---
	<h2>General Things I'd Like To Do (In no particular order)</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>Read more books and articles. I'm building a collection of <a href="/lists/articles.html">articles</a> that I find particularly interesting. </li>
	  <li>Gain a better understanding of how people learn. Especially which information presentation and student approaches make things engaging. In and out of school, about subjects that are obviously practical and not so much, "for fun" and whatever the opposite of that is. </li>
	  <li>Write more, and more consistently. Write to explain my thoughts concisely and clearly. My <a href ="/blog/index.html">blog</a> will be used for practice.</li>
	  <li>Learn more about data. Data mining, analysis, visualization, and current work in the field.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Other Fun Things</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>I run. I run to relax and organize my thoughts. I especially like wandering long runs.</li>
	  <li>I play violin. When I was 10 my dream was to become a violinist, but now I mostly just play for myself. My favorite piece is Ziguenerweisen, and my favorite section of a piece is<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTE08SS8fNk&t=2m0s"> this one part</a> of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto. I like listening to The Piano Guys, 2Cellos, and Pentatonix.</li>
	  <li>I play tennis.
	  <li>I also like reading Quora and making lists.</li>
	</ul>
