<div class="blurb">
	<h1>General Things I'd Like To Do (In no particular order)</h1>
	  <li>Read more. I have an increasing <a href="/lists/books">list of books</a> and am building a collection of <a href="/lists/articles">articles</a> I particularly like. </li>
	  <li>Gain a better understanding of how people learn. Especially which information presentation and student approaches make things engaging. In and out of school, about subjects that are obviously practical and not so much, "for fun" and whatever the opposite of that is. </li>
	  <li>Write more, and more consistently. Write to organize my thoughts inside my head and to practice explaining things to people who can't see inside my head.</li>
	  <li>Learn more about data. Data mining, analysis, visualization, and current work in the field.</li>
	<h1>Specific Things I'm Learning</h1>
	<ul>
	  <li>Another increasingly long <a href="/lists/learning">list</a> that I'm working on</li>
	</ul>
	<h1>Other Fun Things</h1>
	<ul>
	  <li>I run. After a shaky relationship with running when I played tennis in high school, it's one of my favorite things to do. Wandering long jogs are my favorite, and I'm working on pushing myself to run faster.</li>
	  <li>I play violin. I used to want to be a professional violinist; now I play in the Princeton University Sinfonia and when I'm working on learning a backlog of pieces I'd like to learn. My favorite piece is Ziguenerweisen, and my favorite section of a piece is<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTE08SS8fNk&t=2m0s"> this one part</a> of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto. I like listening to The Piano Guys, 2Cellos, and Pentatonix.</li>
	  <li>I play tennis. Less often than I'd like.</li>
	  <li>
	</ul>
