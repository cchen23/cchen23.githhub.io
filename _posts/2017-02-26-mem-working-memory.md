## Motivation

In posterior parts of the cortex, activing a set of neurons easily activates other connected neurons, which helps in making inferences based on partial information. However, sometimes we want to hold onto certain information instead of letting patterns of activations spread to new memories. This requires *working memory*, or the ability to maintain and manipulate certain thoughts.
The prefrontal cortex, which has less connectivity between neurons and has the ability to sustain patterns of activation, allows us to use working memory. 

## Components

A model of working memory consists of three main parts: the Phonological Loop, the Visual-Spatial Sketchpad (VSSP), and the Central Executive. The Phonological Loop and VSSP provide the ability to maintain information, and the central executive provides to ability to manipulate information in working memory.

### Phonological Loop

We use the Phonological Loop by repeating verbal information over and over again, which keeps the information sustained in memory. The Phonological Similarity Effect and the Word-Length Effect provide evidence for the phonological loop. In memory tests, people have more trouble remembering lists of similar-sounding words, which implies that they maintain the information using the sounds of the words (This is the Phonological Similarity Effect). People also tend to remember fewer words when the words are longer, which implies that the Phonological Loop has a maximum time-span before a memory must be refreshed: longer words take longer to repeat, so fewer can be held in the Phonological Loop (This is the Word-Length Effect). 

### Visual-Spatial Sketchpad

The Visual-Spatial Sketchpad is a component of working memory that stores information about where items are and what they look like. One experiment that provides evidence for the VSSP found that people could remember multiple aspects of items without diminishing the number of items they could remember, which implies that people were not using the Phonological Loop to remember aspects of the items. In addition, people's performance on tasks involving the maintainance of visual/spatial information suffered when they were given a distractor task that also involved using visual/spatial information, which indicates that people use visual and spatial processing capabilities when remembering this information.

### Central Executive

The Phonological Loop and the VSSP maintain information in working memory, but in order to do useful things we need to be able to manipulate that information. The Central Executive provides this ability.

## Use: Inhibiting Inappropriate Response

Working memory does not only hold information about stimuli; it can also hold information about tasks and make people engage in the appropriate response to a task. For example, in the Stroop task people see words that name colors and are written in a certain color. They try to say the color of the word, rather than the word itself, which requires them to override the default response of reading the text of a word. The prefrontal cortex maintains the task (reading the color of the word), and by doing so it causes the person to choose the correct response. The PFC might accomplish this by strengthening activations to neurons for the correct response, which in turn inhibit activations of neurons for the incorrect response.
Furthermore, patients with damage to the PFC have trouble changing to a new task. This indicates that the PFC (and working memory) are responsible for maintaining task representations and inhibiting inappropriate responses to a situation.
