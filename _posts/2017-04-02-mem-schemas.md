# Schemas

Schemas are chunks of information about the world in general. They include scripts, which describe events and consequences such as how to act at a restaurant, and frames, which describe things in the world with fixed and variable components (such as the fact that chairs have a place to sit and a back but come in various forms).

## Benefits

Schemas help us by providing a shortcut for perceiving and remembering events. We can draw upon schemas to fill in gaps in our understanding, make predictions about the world and take action if things differ from our expectations, prevent cognitive overload, and facilitate our perception of the physical world.

## Drawbacks
However, they can also hinder our understanding and problem-solving. For instance, we might have schemas that contain incorrect stereotypes about a situation. By drawing on the schema, we might form an easier but incorrect conclusion.

## Experimental Evidence

In various experiments, researchers have shown that we tend to falsely recall things that we expect based on a certain schema, such as books in a professor's office. Furthermore, we are more likely to remember things that are highly schema-inconsistent, since their difference from the expected schema elicits surprise.

Researchers have also found that we tend to use schemas at encoding, rather than retrieval. In an experiment, subjects received a description of a picture and either saw the picture before or after reading the description. Seeing the picture before the description helped the subjects relate the description to the schema of the picture, which allowed subjects to remember more ideas from the description. However, viewing the picture after reading the description (after encoding memories of the description) did not help subjects remember more ideas.
