## Idea: Interference

When we learn something, weights between neurons in the brain adjust to create memory traces of the information we learned. When we want to remember what we learned, we retrieve those memory traces to access the information. However, the cue for information we want to retrieve might activate multiple sets of memory traces, each of which compete to be the memory we retrieve. This competition can lead to interference, which prevents us from accessing the memory we want to retrieve. In proactive interference, something we learned earlier interferes with our ability to remember something we learned later. In retroactive interference, something we learned later interferes with our ability to remember something we learned earler.

## Memory Strategies and Super-memorizers

One way to strengthen a memory is to use semantic elaboration, which involves processing a given piece of information more deeply. By processing the information more deeply, we create a more unique memory trace, that will be easier to retrieve when we later want to remember the memory.

Other methods such as the method of loci, in which people visualize information they want to remember along a path, and the method of pegwords, in which people visualize information together with an already-remembered set of cues, involve creating unique visual representations of the information. Doing this engages more parts of the brain, which helps to create more unique memory traces that are easier to retrieve. In addition, these two methods include two components: meaningful encoding, which makes the memory traces less subject to interference, and an "anchor" (the path in the method of loci, and the pre-memorized set of words in the method of pegwords) that gives people a way to access the memory traces they have created.
