Starting this semester, I aim to summarize the ideas I learn about in a concise, accessible manner through blog posts on this site. I hope to write posts that are both interesting and to the point, using whichever format seems best suited for the material at hand. In particular, I'd like to work on presenting and motivating particularly detailed/technical material in a clear way.

I have two main motivations for this project:
* One of my ongoing goals is to more consisely and effectively communicate my ideas, with special emphasis to presentation format.
* I believe that distilling lectures/lengthy readings into short summaries allows me understand information at a deeper level.
