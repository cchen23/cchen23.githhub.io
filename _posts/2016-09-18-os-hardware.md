## CPU/Processor: Executive

The central processing unit carries out programs. To do this, it processes instructions: it *fetches* them from memory, *decodes* what to do, and *executes* the task.

## Memory: Storage

Computer memory holds information. Computers have different types of memory that differ in terms of size, speed, and cost, and computers use the different types of memory for different tasks. Types of memory also differ in terms of volatility: some types retain information without connection to power, while other types do not.

## I/O Devices: External Communication

People use many different types of I/O devices to communicate with computers, so intermediary objects help the computer communicate with all the different kinds of devices. *Controllers* provide an interfact to abstract away some of the complexity of the device, and *device drivers* are software that allows computers to understand the information coming from the controller, since controllers provide different interfaces.

## Buses: Internal Communication

Computers use buses to communicate data between different components.
