## Intro to the 
Propositional logic is a logic system that combines propositional symbols, which are atomic units, to build increasingly complex formulas. For example, one could build the formula A AND B by joining the symbols "A" and "B" with the connection "AND".
A model assigns a value to each propositional symbol. In a system of boolean logic, each symbol receives a value of either 0 or 1. For a given formula, some models make it true while other models make it false. For example, a model that assigns 0 to "A" and 1 to "B" would make the formula "A AND B" equal 0 (false), while a model that assigns 1 to "A" and "B" would make the formula "A AND B" equal 1 (true).

## Terminology
**M(f)**: the set of models that make a formula true.
**Tautology**: a formula that is true for any possible model.
**Contradiction**: a formula that is false for any possible model.
**Knowledge Base**: a set of formulae.
  **M(KB)**: the set of models that make all the formulae in a knowledge base true. A knowledge base is **satisfiable** if this set is not empty.
  A knowledge base **contradicts** a formula if no model exists that can make both the formula and all the formulae in the knowledge base true.
  A knowledge base **entails** a formula if every model that makes the knowledge base true also makes the formula true.
  A knowledge base is **consistent** with a formula if there is at least one model that makes both the knowledge base and the formula true.
  
## Resolution Procedure
If we have a knowledge base that consists of a certain type of formula, we can figure out if it is satisfiable. First, we convert every formula in the knowledge base into a form that consists only of "OR" conjunctions, variables, and negated variables. Then, we look for pairs of formulae in which one formula contains a variable and the other formula contains the negation of the variable. If such a pair exists, we add a formula to the knowledge base. We create the added formula by "OR"ing together all the variables in both formulae (except for the variable that is negated in one pair and not negated in the other pair). We keep doing this until either we can find no more pairs, or we find a pair of formulae in which one formula contains a single variable and the other formula contains only a negated version of the same variable. In the former case, the knowledge base is satisfiable since each variable occurs either only in its negated form or only in its non-negated form. In this case, we just assign "1" to a variable that occurs in its non-negated form and "0" to a variable that occurs in its negated form. In the latter case, there is no way that both formulae in the pair can be true, so the knowledge base is not satisfiable.
