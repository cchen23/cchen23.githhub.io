Repeated exposure to a stimulus causes [repetition suppression](https://cchen23.github.io/blog/2017/02/22/mem-repetition-suppression). A less active, more sharp pattern of activity occurs in the cortex as the cortical neurons become more tuned to the stimulus. Because of this, the brain can use ease of processing a stimulus as a measure of its familiarity.

Usually, this is a useful shortcut, but this approach can also backfire. Previous experiments showed that other scenarios that elicited easier processing lead people to mistakenly believe that they had seen a stimulus before. For instance, when people viewed easier-to-read words, words in a more predictable context, or subtly primed words, they were more likely to (mistakenly) think they had seen the word before.
In related experiments, subjects were more likely to (mistakenly) think that a name corresponded to a famous person if they had encountered the name in a separate test a day prior.

However, if the subjects realized that they had been primed with a word, or that the names might have come from a list in a previous test, they were not as likely to prefer the word or guess that the name corresponded to a famous person.
