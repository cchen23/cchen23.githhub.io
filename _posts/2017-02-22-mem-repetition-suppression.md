When the same stimulus is repeatedly presented, overall neuron response decreases. This could be explained by the way in which the cortex learns.

Upon receiving a novel stimululs, the cortex's neurons have not learned about the stimululs, so the weights between the inputs from the stimululs and the cortex's neurons are random. By chance, some neurons will respond more strongly, but not by much, so a large number of neurons are activated weakly.
Some neurons are a little more strongly activated, and the cortex [learns](https://cchen23.github.io/blog/2017/02/09/mem-learning-nn) to strengthen the weights to these neurons. The connections between the input and a small set of neurons becomes stronger, at the cost of connections to other neurons. Over time, the cortex learns to activate a select set of neurons in response to the stimulus, so when it receives input from that stimulus, it activates a much smaller number of neurons.
