## Contextual Drift

At each moment in time, we have some context consisting of the thoughts in our mind and the environment we are in. The hippocampus binds together these items. When we try to remember a memory, our mental context while remembering acts as a set of contextual cues, which helps us better remember items from contexts that match the mental context we have while remembering.
Over time, our mental and environmental contexts drifts, which allows us to (in general) better remember more recent items.

## Context-Dependent Memory

In experiments in which subjects learn lists of words in different contexts, they remember more items when the context during retrieval matches the context during encoding. Specifically, divers who learned words on land and underwater remembered more words if their state while trying to remember the words (underwater or on land) matched their state while learning the words.

When people try to remember events, they can perform "mental time travel" by trying to reinstate their context during the event, and using the cues from that context to better recall aspects of the event.

## Example: Motivated Forgetting of Lists of Words

In one experiment, subjects were given a list of words to remember, asked to forget it, then given another list of words to remember. This impaired their ability to remember the first list of words, and experimenters hypothesized that this impairment happened because subjects created a new context after being told to forget the first list. Further findings confirmed this. They showed that presenting a word from the first list (reinstating the context of the first list) could reverse the impairment of the first list, that providing three lists and asking subjects to forget the second list impaired memory of the first list as well, and that asking subjects to imagine some other context after learning a list similarly impaired recall of that list.
