# What do OS do?

Computers became more and more complex and then two things happened:
1. Hardware became too complicated for people to deal with directly.
2. Computers could run multiple programs at the same time, which also complicated things.

Operating systems respond to both problems:
1. They give interfaces so programmers can deal with hardware more simply.
2. They help programs share hardware resources when multiple programs run at the same time. This is done in two main ways:
  1. The OS might make the programs take turns using resource. (Programs use the full resource, some  of the time.)
  2. The OS might split up resources into parts, and let each program use a part of the resources. (Programs use part of the resource, all of the time.)

# How did OS develop?
At first, computers did not have operating systems and people interacted directly with hardware. As computers became more complicated, people developed operating systems to abstract away the complexity. As computers became cheaper, human labor became comparatively more expensive so manufacturers found ways to use less human time (for example, giving each person their own terminal or computer so they don't have to wait a long time for results). 
Throughout the development of operating systems, people found techniques to make things more efficient:

* Batch systems: When computers ran programs by reading a punched card, loading each card individually wasted time. People read many cards onto a magnetic tape so that the computer could automatically start the next program after it finished executing a program.
* Multiprogramming: Originally, computers ran jobs one by one. A single job didn't use up all of the computer's CPU all the time. People ran jobs at the same time to use a higher percentage of the computer's CPU.
  * Timesharing: One way to use the CPU more fully was to give each user a terminal connected to the same computer, since each user did not need to use the full CPU all the time.
