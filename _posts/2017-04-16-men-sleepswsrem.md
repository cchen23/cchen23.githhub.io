## Evidence that Sleep Helps Learning

Various experiments have shown a benefit to learning from sleep. In particular, experiments have shown that periods of sleep between learning and testing (as opposed to periods of wake) benefit memory, and that lack of sleep the night after items are learned impairs memory of the items, even when subjects are allowed to sleep on following nights.
In addition, the benefit of sleep on learning seems to require that people have two types of sleep: SWS and REM sleep.

## Stages of Sleep

Sleep can be categorized into two types: REM and NREM. During REM sleep, the brain shows activity similar to waking activity. NREM sleep can be further divided into 4 stages (numbered 1-4). Stages 3-4 of NREM constitute SWS. People's sleep cycles tend to include more SWS earlier in the night and more REM sleep later in the night.

## Theory: SWS and REM work together to Integrate Memory

One theory states that during SWS and REM the brain consolidates memories: during SWS, the hippocampus replays episodic memories to cortex, and during REM these memories are integrated with other knowledge in a way that helps protect preexisting memories from damage.
